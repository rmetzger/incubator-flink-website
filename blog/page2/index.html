				<div><p>Our paper &quot;“All Roads Lead to Rome:” Optimistic Recovery for Distributed
Iterative Data Processing&quot; authored by Sebastian Schelter, Kostas
Tzoumas, Stephan Ewen and Volker Markl has been accepted accepted at the
ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management
(CIKM 2013) in San Francisco.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>Executing data-parallel iterative algorithms on large datasets is
crucial for many advanced analytical applications in the fields of data
mining and machine learning. Current systems for executing iterative
tasks in large clusters typically achieve fault tolerance through
rollback recovery. The principle behind this pessimistic approach is to
periodically checkpoint the algorithm state. Upon failure, the system
restores a consistent state from a previously written checkpoint and
resumes execution from that point.</p>

<p>We propose an optimistic recovery mechanism using algorithmic
compensations. Our method leverages the robust, self-correcting nature
of a large class of fixpoint algorithms used in data mining and machine
learning, which converge to the correct solution from various
intermediate consistent states. In the case of a failure, we apply a
user-defined compensate function that algorithmically creates such a
consistent state, instead of rolling back to a previous checkpointed
state. Our optimistic recovery does not checkpoint any state and hence
achieves optimal failure-free performance with respect to the overhead
necessary for guaranteeing fault tolerance. We illustrate the
applicability of this approach for three wide classes of problems.
Furthermore, we show how to implement the proposed optimistic recovery
mechanism in a data flow system. Similar to the Combine operator in
MapReduce, our proposed functionality is optional and can be applied to
increase performance without changing the semantics of programs. In an
experimental evaluation on large datasets, we show that our proposed
approach provides optimal failure-free performance. In the absence of
failures our optimistic scheme is able to outperform a pessimistic
approach by a factor of two to five. In presence of failures, our
approach provides fast recovery and outperforms pessimistic approaches
in the majority of cases.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
The importance of social-media platforms and online communities - in business as well as public context - is more and more acknowledged and appreciated by industry and researchers alike. Consequently, a wide range of analytics has been proposed to understand, steer, and exploit the mechanics and laws driving their functionality and creating the resulting benefits. However, analysts usually face significant problems in scaling existing and novel approaches to match the data volume and size of modern online communities. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the usage of the massively parallel data prossesing system Stratosphere, based on second order functions as an extended notion of the MapReduce paradigm, to provide a new level of scalability to such social-media analytics. Based on the popular example of role analysis, we present and illustrate how this massively parallel approach can be leveraged to scale out complex data-mining tasks, while providing a programming approach that eases the formulation of complete analytical workflows.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Analyzing big data sets as they occur in modern business and science applications requires query languages that allow for the specification of complex data processing tasks. Moreover, these ideally declarative query specifications have to be optimized, parallelized and scheduled for processing on massively parallel data processing platforms. This paper demonstrates the application of Stratosphere to different kinds of Big Data Analytics tasks. Using examples from different application domains, we show how to formulate analytical tasks as Meteor queries and execute them with Stratosphere. These examples include data cleansing and information extraction tasks, and a correlation analysis of microblogging and stock trade volume data that we describe in detail in this paper.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Data flows are a popular abstraction to define data-intensive processing tasks. In order to support a wide range of use cases, many data processing systems feature MapReduce-style user-defined functions (UDFs). In contrast to UDFs as known from relational DBMS, MapReduce-style UDFs have less strict templates. These templates do not alone provide all the information needed to decide whether they can be reordered with relational operators and other UDFs. However, it is well-known that reordering operators such as filters, joins, and aggregations can yield runtime improvements by orders of magnitude.<br />
We demonstrate an optimizer for data flows that is able to reorder operators with MapReduce-style UDFs written in an imperative language. Our approach leverages static code analysis to extract information from UDFs which is used to reason about the reorderbility of UDF operators. This information is sufficient to enumerate a large fraction of the search space covered by conventional RDBMS optimizers including filter and aggregation push-down, bushy join orders, and choice of physical execution strategies based on interesting properties.<br />
We demonstrate our optimizer and a job submission client that allows users to peek step-by-step into each phase of the optimization process: the static code analysis of UDFs, the enumeration of reordered candidate data flows, the generation of physical execution plans, and their parallel execution. For the demonstration, we provide a selection of relational and non-relational data flow programs which highlight the salient features of our approach.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">Overview</h1>

<p>The default configuration parameters allow Flink to run out-of-the-box
in single node setups.</p>

<p>This page lists the most common options that are typically needed to set
up a well performing (distributed) installation. In addition a full
list of all available configuration parameters is listed here.</p>

<p>All configuration is done in <code>conf/flink-conf.yaml</code>, which is expected to be
a flat collection of <a href="http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML key value pairs</a>
with format <code>key: value</code>.</p>

<p>The system and run scripts parse the config at startup time. Changes to the configuration
file require restarting the Flink JobManager and TaskManagers.</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">Common Options</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><code>env.java.home</code>: The path to the Java installation to use (DEFAULT: system&#39;s
default Java installation, if found). Needs to be specified if the startup
scipts fail to automatically resolve the java home directory. Can be specified
to point to a specific java installation or version. If this option is not
specified, the startup scripts also evaluate the <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable.</p></li>
<li><p><code>jobmanager.rpc.address</code>: The IP address of the JobManager, which is the
master/coordinator of the distributed system (DEFAULT: localhost).</p></li>
<li><p><code>jobmanager.rpc.port</code>: The port number of the JobManager (DEFAULT: 6123).</p></li>
<li><p><code>jobmanager.heap.mb</code>: JVM heap size (in megabytes) for the JobManager
(DEFAULT: 256).</p></li>
<li><p><code>taskmanager.heap.mb</code>: JVM heap size (in megabytes) for the TaskManagers,
which are the parallel workers of the system. In
contrast to Hadoop, Flink runs operators (e.g., join, aggregate) and
user-defined functions (e.g., Map, Reduce, CoGroup) inside the TaskManager
(including sorting/hashing/caching), so this value should be as
large as possible (DEFAULT: 512). On YARN setups, this value is automatically
configured to the size of the TaskManager&#39;s YARN container, minus a
certain tolerance value.</p></li>
<li><p><code>taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots</code>: The number of parallel operator or
UDF instances that a single TaskManager can run (DEFAULT: 1).
If this value is larger than 1, a single TaskManager takes multiple instances of
a function or operator. That way, the TaskManager can utilize multiple CPU cores,
but at the same time, the available memory is divided between the different
operator or function instances.
This value is typically proportional to the number of physical CPU cores that
the TaskManager&#39;s machine has (e.g., equal to the number of cores, or half the
number of cores).</p></li>
<li><p><code>parallelization.degree.default</code>: The default degree of parallelism to use for
programs that have no degree of parallelism specified. (DEFAULT: 1). For
setups that have no concurrent jobs running, setting this value to
NumTaskManagers * NumSlotsPerTaskManager will cause the system to use all
available execution resources for the program&#39;s execution.</p></li>
<li><p><code>fs.hdfs.hadoopconf</code>: The absolute path to the Hadoop File System&#39;s (HDFS)
configuration directory (OPTIONAL VALUE).
Specifying this value allows programs to reference HDFS files using short URIs
(<code>hdfs:///path/to/files</code>, without including the address and port of the NameNode
in the file URI). Without this option, HDFS files can be accessed, but require
fully qualified URIs like <code>hdfs://address:port/path/to/files</code>.
This option also causes file writers to pick up the HDFS&#39;s default values for block sizes
and replication factors. Flink will look for the &quot;core-site.xml&quot; and
&quot;hdfs-site.xml&quot; files in teh specified directory.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_2">Advanced Options</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><code>taskmanager.tmp.dirs</code>: The directory for temporary files, or a list of
directories separated by the systems directory delimiter (for example &#39;:&#39;
(colon) on Linux/Unix). If multiple directories are specified, then the temporary
files will be distributed across the directories in a round-robin fashion. The
I/O manager component will spawn one reading and one writing thread per
directory. A directory may be listed multiple times to have the I/O manager use
multiple threads for it (for example if it is physically stored on a very fast
disc or RAID) (DEFAULT: The system&#39;s tmp dir).</p></li>
<li><p><code>jobmanager.web.port</code>: Port of the JobManager&#39;s web interface (DEFAULT: 8081).</p></li>
<li><p><code>fs.overwrite-files</code>: Specifies whether file output writers should overwrite
existing files by default. Set to <em>true</em> to overwrite by default, <em>false</em> otherwise.
(DEFAULT: false)</p></li>
<li><p><code>fs.output.always-create-directory</code>: File writers running with a parallelism
larger than one create a directory for the output file path and put the different
result files (one per parallel writer task) into that directory. If this option
is set to <em>true</em>, writers with a parallelism of 1 will also create a directory
and place a single result file into it. If the option is set to <em>false</em>, the
writer will directly create the file directly at the output path, without
creating a containing directory. (DEFAULT: false)</p></li>
<li><p><code>taskmanager.network.numberOfBuffers</code>: The number of buffers available to the
network stack. This number determines how many streaming data exchange channels
a TaskManager can have at the same time and how well buffered the channels are.
If a job is rejected or you get a warning that the system has not enough buffers
available, increase this value (DEFAULT: 2048).</p></li>
<li><p><code>taskmanager.memory.size</code>: The amount of memory (in megabytes) that the task
manager reserves on the JVM&#39;s heap space for sorting, hash tables, and caching
of intermediate results. If unspecified (-1), the memory manager will take a fixed
ratio of the heap memory available to the JVM, as specified by
<code>taskmanager.memory.fraction</code>. (DEFAULT: -1)</p></li>
<li><p><code>taskmanager.memory.fraction</code>: The relative amount of memory that the task
manager reserves for sorting, hash tables, and caching of intermediate results.
For example, a value of 0.8 means that TaskManagers reserve 80% of the
JVM&#39;s heap space for internal data buffers, leaving 20% of the JVM&#39;s heap space
free for objects created by user-defined functions. (DEFAULT: 0.7)
This parameter is only evaluated, if <code>taskmanager.memory.size</code> is not set.</p></li>
</ul>
